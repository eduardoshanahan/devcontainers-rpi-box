# 2025-12-21

- Create `src/playbooks/pi-apps.yml` for permanent application deployments (keeping `pi-base` focused on OS/infra).
- Implement the first real application (e.g., Pi-hole) using the Docker Compose roles.

## **Next session reminder**

- Run `./scripts/ansible-smoke.sh src/playbooks/pi-base.yml src/inventory/hosts.ini` to ensure base stability before adding apps.
- **Action Item**: Verify the physical backup location (`/mnt/backup`) is mounted and writable on `rpi_box_01`.
- **Action Item**: Rotate the default Restic password in `host_vars` to a secure secret.
