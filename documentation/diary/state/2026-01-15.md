# State for 2026-01-15

- Working: Raspberry Pi cloud-init seed netplan config is DHCP-only (`sd_card_files/system-boot/network-config.example` and `sd_card_files/system-boot/network-config`).
- Working: Documentation now reflects the intended DNS + netplan architecture (DHCP + UniFi reservations; DNS via UniFi DHCP), including `documentation/how to use this project.md`.
- Working: Markdown files no longer contain emoji characters (repo markdown policy).
- Next: after each box is deployed and has a DHCP lease, create a UniFi DHCP reservation (MAC -> fixed IP) and set the UniFi network DHCP DNS servers to Pi-hole primary/secondary.
- Next: if any already-provisioned box is still static, confirm it has converged to DHCP (`ip a`, `resolvectl status`, and `netplan get`).
