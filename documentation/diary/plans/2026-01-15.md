# Plans for 2026-01-15

- Align Raspberry Pi networking to `DNS-and-netplan-decisions.md` (DHCP + UniFi reservations; DNS via UniFi DHCP).
- Keep documentation consistent with the DHCP-first approach (cloud-init seed workflow and decision notes).
- Enforce the repo markdown policy of no emoji characters in `.md` files.
