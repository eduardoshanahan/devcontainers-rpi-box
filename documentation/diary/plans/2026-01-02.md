# Plans for 2026-01-02

- Add LTS upgrade awareness to daily reporting and a manual upgrade playbook.
- Align repo shell scripts with POSIX `sh` per `agents.md`.
- Ensure Docker installs remain reliable if the repo is missing a candidate containerd.io version.
- Keep docs in sync with workflow changes and deployment outcomes.
