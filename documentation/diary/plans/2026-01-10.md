# Plans for 2026-01-10

- Re-run `playbooks/pi-base.yml` against `rpi_box_03` to confirm the `pi_base` assert fix and Docker repo detection work end-to-end.
- Verify `docker-ce` is available after repo setup (`apt-cache policy docker-ce`) and that the install tasks proceed.
- If `docker-ce` is still unavailable, capture `ansible_distribution`, `ansible_distribution_release`, and the generated repo line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list`.
- Add a standard tmux workspace launcher (`make workspace`) to orchestrate devcontainer/editor/Claude/SSH windows.
