# Recap for 2026-01-10

- Fixed `pi_base` task YAML: `fail_msg` must be nested under `ansible.builtin.assert` to avoid conflicting action statements.
- Fixed `docker_engine` Docker apt repository configuration by auto-detecting Debian vs Ubuntu and using the matching `download.docker.com` URLs; added a fail-fast assert that `docker_engine_apt_release` matches `ansible_distribution_release`.
- Updated documentation to clarify `docker_engine_apt_release` expectations and the optional `docker_engine_apt_repo_os` override.
- Updated `documentation/fast start.md` to be a better quick reference and added it to `documentation/README.md` (documentation index).
- Updated `scripts/ansible-smoke.sh` to accept an optional `--limit`-style third argument (host/group) and documented it.
- Fixed `ansible-lint` yaml line-length failures by wrapping long lines in `docker_engine` and `pi_base` task files.
- Expanded ADR-0006 with a monthly review cadence and an upgrade procedure for pinned toolchain versions; linked it from the documentation index.
- Switched the `NODE_EXPORTER_LISTEN_ADDRESS` example in `.env.example` to `127.0.0.1:9100` and documented the recommended secure default until Prometheus exists.
- Updated local `.env` to bind node exporter to `127.0.0.1:9100` so all boxes using env lookups stop exposing `:9100` on the LAN by default.
- Added a “dry-run and review changes” example to `documentation/fast start.md` for applying `pi-base.yml` to boxes already running services.
- Added ADR-0011 (Proposed) to capture the intended Prometheus/node-exporter/Grafana monitoring architecture and security defaults.
