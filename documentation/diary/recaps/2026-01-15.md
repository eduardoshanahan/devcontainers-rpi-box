# Recap for 2026-01-15

- Implemented the DHCP-first netplan approach from `DNS-and-netplan-decisions.md`.
- Updated cloud-init seed netplan configs:
  - `sd_card_files/system-boot/network-config.example` now uses `dhcp4: true` (no static addressing, gateway, or nameservers).
  - `sd_card_files/system-boot/network-config` updated to match the DHCP-only config.
- Updated docs to match the decision (DHCP reservations and DHCP-advertised DNS via UniFi) and removed stale references to old paths.
- Removed emoji characters from markdown files to comply with repo policy.
