# 2026-01-02

- Added an LTS availability check to the daily report email output.
- Added a manual `ubuntu-lts-upgrade.yml` playbook that requires explicit confirmation.
- Documented the LTS upgrade flow in `how to use this project.md`.
- Converted repo-authored shell scripts to POSIX `sh` and removed bashisms.
- Updated smoke test script to stream output while still checking idempotence.
- Switched backup and daily report templates to `#!/bin/sh` and adjusted a non-POSIX `tail` usage.
- Replaced role defaults with required variables plus asserts, and documented the required values.
- Updated `.env.example` with anonymized values and restored `.env` with real values plus required vars.
- Added ripgrep to the devcontainer image for faster repo searches.
- Hardened Docker install logic to handle transient Docker repo gaps by falling back to available containerd.io versions.
- Deployed `pi-base` successfully on `rpi_box_03` with containerd.io 2.2.0 (fallback) and Docker Engine 29.1.3.
