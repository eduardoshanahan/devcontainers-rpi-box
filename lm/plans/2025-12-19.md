# Plans for 2025-12-19

- First application (e.g., Pi-hole) as a compose stack.
- Add docker-specific smoke tests (daemon status, `docker run hello-world`).

## **Next session reminder**

- Re-run `ansible-playbook src/playbooks/pi-base.yml -l rpi_box_01` to confirm the daily report fix applies cleanly.
- Run `./scripts/ansible-smoke.sh src/playbooks/pi-base.yml src/inventory/hosts.ini` to validate lint + idempotence.

## Longer-Term (After Docker Is Stable)

- First application (e.g., Pi-hole) as a compose stack.
- Add docker-specific smoke tests (daemon status, `docker run hello-world`).
