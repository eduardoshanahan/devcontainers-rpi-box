# State for 2026-01-05

- Added root-level launchers `devcontainer-launch.sh` and `claude-launch.sh`.
- CLI launchers support `REBUILD_CONTAINER=1` and `KEEP_CONTAINER=1`.
- Claude install now runs in `.devcontainer/scripts/post-create.sh` (opt-out with `SKIP_CLAUDE_INSTALL=1`).
- Smoke test image pinned and teardown is guaranteed via `block`/`always`.
- `pi_base` apt cache refresh no longer breaks idempotency checks.
- Inventory host vars were wrapped to satisfy yamllint line-length rules.
