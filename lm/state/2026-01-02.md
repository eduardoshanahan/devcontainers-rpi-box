# 2026-01-02

- Working: daily report includes LTS upgrade check; manual LTS upgrade playbook in place.
- Working: repo-owned scripts are POSIX `sh` compliant (vendored `src/collections/**` scripts unchanged).
- Working: role defaults removed; required variables enforced via asserts and documented.
- Working: `.env.example` anonymized; `.env` restored with real values and required vars.
- Working: devcontainer installs ripgrep for fast repo search.
- Working: Docker install handles transient repo gaps by falling back to available containerd.io versions.
- Working: `pi-base` applied successfully to `rpi_box_03`.
- Pending: re-run `pi-base` later if you want containerd.io to converge to the newest candidate once the repo recovers.
