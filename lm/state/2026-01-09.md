# State for 2026-01-09

- Working: devcontainer workspace mount now targets `${localEnv:WORKSPACE_FOLDER}` (matches `workspaceFolder`).
- Working: SSH agent forwarding now uses a stable `/ssh-agent` socket path (bind-mount + `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent`).
- Working: VS Code terminal profile settings moved under `customizations.vscode.settings` so they apply correctly.
- Working: devcontainer now stops the container on window close via `"shutdownAction": "stopContainer"`.
- Working: `verify-git-ssh.sh` no longer defaults to GitHub; it requires a git host via arg or `GIT_SSH_HOST`.
- Working: `validate-env.sh` fails fast if `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is missing/invalid on the host.
- Working: `post-create.sh` now runs env validation, adds a bashrc guard for VS Code shell integration, and uses safer Claude install logic.
- Working: `bash-prompt.sh` disables nounset (`set +u`) to avoid VS Code shell integration issues in interactive shells.
