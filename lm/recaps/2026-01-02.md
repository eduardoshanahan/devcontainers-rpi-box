# Recap for 2026-01-02

- Added an LTS availability check to the daily report and a manual upgrade playbook.
- Converted repo-authored shell scripts to POSIX `sh` and tightened environment validation.
- Removed role defaults and enforced required variables with asserts, then updated `.env` docs.
- Added Docker repo resilience by falling back to available containerd.io versions.
- Deployed `pi-base` to `rpi_box_03` successfully; Docker 29.1.3 with containerd.io 2.2.0 fallback.
