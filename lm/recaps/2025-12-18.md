# Recap for 2025-12-18.md

- Extended `pi_base` with admin access hardening (SSH key auth, passwordless sudo, disable password auth + root login) plus hostname/timezone/locale configuration.
- Enforced explicit `pi_base_*` variables (no defaults) and set host-specific values in `host_vars`.
- Added unattended upgrades role and wired it into the base playbook.
- Added a common tools role (nano, curl, git, tmux, htop, jq, rsync, etc.).
- Added a daily report role (msmtp + systemd timer + report script) and documented required SMTP variables.
- Updated docs:
  - `documentation/how to use this project.md`
  - `documentation/how to test.md`
- Updated host_vars example and live host vars to reflect new required variables.
