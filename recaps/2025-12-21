- Included `community.docker` in `requirements.yml`.
- Created `docker_smoke_test` role to deploy a transient `whoami` container for verification.
- Updated `pi-base` playbook to include the smoke test as the final step.
- Established a pattern for validating Docker networking and cleanup automatically.
- Verified the entire stack (idempotence + smoke checks) on `rpi_box_01`.
